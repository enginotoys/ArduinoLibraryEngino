The STEM & Robotics Produino education set is specially designed for High school children of ages 14+ and hobby engineers. With all the mechanical plastic parts and electronics, it teaches effectively the core subjects of STEM together with Robotics and Coding. The set is powered by the new advanced Produino controller. The innovation of Produino lies in it’s brain which incorporates the open source Arduino platform which means 3rd party sensors, shields and programming software can be used. The Produino graphical software provided with the kit, provides a Scratch-like based environment with drag and drop blocks and includes an Arduino editor for advanced text programming. The program can run on Android and iOs tablets, Mac, Windows and Linux.

The company history
Engino.net Ltd was founded in 2004 by Costas Sisamos in Cyprus. With degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Education, Costas worked for 10 years in Primary schools teaching Design & Technology. With a vision to inspire his students become better problem solvers and future innovators, Costas started designing a new system of modular connectors that would enable students to build fast and easy fully functional technological models. The award of research capital by European Union supported the first 3 years of development, and the first ENGINO® sets were launched in 2007 attracting the interest of international toy buyers and education specialists. The patented ability of the system to snap fit on multiple locations while maintaining simple manufacturing methods was a feature that unleashed great potential. Since the launch, the system has received several local and international awards, while the company's R&D team continues to develop new innovations taking ENGINO® to the 3rd generation of construction toys. Now, with a product range of more than 50 different sets, ranging from simple structures and mechanisms to solar energy sets and wireless robotics, ENGINO® is one of the fastest growing companies in the field. This success is reflected in the recent expansion to a new fully automated factory in Cyprus, setting new standards for production in Europe by introducing vertical integration from conception to manufacturing and retail.

Engino mechanical system
ENGINO® brand name uses the same initials, honoring this fundamental and innate human characteristic which empowers us to perform astonishing technological feats. Our children are gifted with this power and through creative play they learn how to exploit it. ENGINO® TOY SYSTEM is perhaps the most advanced and versatile three dimensional construction toy in the market today, offering unique opportunities for creation for both children and adults alike. The toy comprises of a system of multi-faceted rods and connectors that share some unique geometrical features that allow connectivity up to 6 sides simultaneously! In essence, this patent-pending design transforms rods into connectors, leading to builds that may be either dense or with large openings. This feature alone enables children to build fast and easy, simple or complex models, using a very low number of different components and a much lower quantity of parts.
